# Object Detection
This project was developed as a part of Durham College's AI course. It contains object detection for clothing objects. 
Project is complete. We were 4 people in a group. My part was working on computer vision. 

# Methodology

Trained different deep CNN models like ResNet, Inception and VGG16 for image classification. 
Decided to use face detection to get better accuracy. 
After that cropped image based on face location and performed image classification.
Then use simple logic to verify the output.

Detailed output can be seen in below pictures.
